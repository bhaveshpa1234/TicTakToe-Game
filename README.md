This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.

The JavaScript logic ensures smooth turn-based gameplay and automatically determines the winner or a tie. The project demonstrates fundamental web development skills and serves as a fun example of interactive programming.

How to Play

Open the game in a web browser by launching the index.html file.

Two players take turns clicking on the cells of the grid to place their symbol (X or O).

The first player to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

Feel free to explore and enhance the code to add features like score tracking, AI opponent, or customizable themes!
